    <h1>History of puff-puff</h1>
    <p>
      Puff-puff, as it is called in Nigeria, is a traditional African snack made
      of fried dough. Puff-puffs are made of dough containing flour, yeast,
      sugar, butter, salt, water and eggs (which are optional), and deep fried
      in vegetable oil to a golden brown color.
